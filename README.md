# About Me

This page is a simple outline of my all my work - for more detail please see my **[resume](/assets/files/resume.pdf)**.

Not much is on my main **[github](https://github.com/chriswsuarez)** page because most of the code I have written is not open source but you can view an example from our **[object_detection](https://github.com/UTNuclearRobotics/object_detection/tree/main)** repo.  That repo takes in information from YOLO or a similar object detection package and fuses it with Lidar to localize static objects in an environment using a mobile robot.  Please note this code example is from a few years ago and does not reflect my current coding ability but it is a stable repo of which I was the primary contributor.

# Projects

Many of my projects are not open source, but I've linked a couple projects which has some information open for the public.

### **Augmented Robot Environment ([AugRE](https://utnuclearroboticspublic.github.io/Augmented-Robot-Environment/))**

AugRE is an AR application built on Unreal Engine that allows users to easily interface and command robots.  AugRE provides the ability for a medium to large multi-agent team to collaborate to perform tasks such as searching an area.

### **Army Futures Command UTDD Integrated Prototype Project**

This video shows snippets from our long-term autonomy study in which two autonomous vehicles navigated around campus and coordinated a search and inspection of blue barrels.
